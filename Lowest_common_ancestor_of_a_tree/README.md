Lowest Commn ancestor of a tree:

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Notes:

I used recursive solutions here so that I could get return the node when the conditions are satisfied.
For recursive solutions dfs is better, so I chose dfs here

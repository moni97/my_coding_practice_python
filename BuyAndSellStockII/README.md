Notes:
This problem can be solved using greedy approach. 
1. Start by buying the stock on the first day.
2. If the profit is more on the second day, store that profit as current profit, else sell the stock and buy it on the current day.
3. Add the profit obtained and return the profit.
4. If more than two profit is obtained store the maximum.
